            <h2>Nathaniel </h2>

            <p>I have spent nearly 15 years in the hospitality industry. with a strong background in gaming. 
               I have been a duty manager in a few clubs around Canberra. While working in clubs I also owned 
               and operated a small cleaning business for 6 years. I specialised in domestic cleaning but also 
               had a few commercial contracts. During January of 2020 I decided to resign from my full-time role 
               as Duty Manager so I could focus on building the cleaning business so I could sell it. 2 weeks after 
               I resigned from the club I managed to become fully booked and started working 6 days per week, 2 weeks 
               later we were hit with the pandemic, resulting in the sudden loss of 90% of my customer base. After trying
                to keep the business afloat for two months, I made the hardest decision of my life, which was to close the 
                cleaning business indefinitely. After the business closed, I decided to try and up skill by enrolling into a 
                Bachelor of Management. I have completed three units at a university level with a high credit average to date.

                  <h2>Nathaniel - Interest in IT  </h2>
   
               <p>I have been interested in IT for a several years now. It all started back around the time of the 2016 Census from
                   the Australian Bureau of Statistic and the DDos attack that caused the systems to be inaccessible. 
                   Learning about what a DDos attack was, sparked my interest in the IT industry specifically cyber security and 
                   ethical hacking.

            <p>Mr. Enoch Liu is a third year Bachelor of IT student at RMIT University, 
               who has had a keen interest in computer and programming since an early age. 
               He was born in Australia with a Chinese cultural heritage, and with parents 
               that maintain a close connection to their birthplace, Hong Kong. Enoch is fluent in English, 
               (as well as Python, Java, C++ and R, just joking!), and is learning to read and write Chinese and Indonesian.
            </p>

            

                  <h2>Enoch - Interest in IT  </h2>
   
               <p>Enoch is interested in the emerging fields of Quantum Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics 
                  in “monetizing” financial data. “Monetizing” means using data, such as customer purchasing records, to better
                   understand their spending pattern and form targeted marketing strategies, in order to make money. 
                   Quantum computers are predicted to break the current hardware limitations of the conventional 
                   computers we use nowadays due to its much faster processing speed, and research on its programming is 
                   already under way. Artificial Intelligence is becoming more widely used in automated decision making such as 
                   search assistants and self-driving cars, in order to achieve better cost efficiency in business and 
                   convenience in everyday life.

               A locksmith by trade, and a background in sales, I have spent the last 10 years 
               jumping out of planes. Skydiving started as a hobby and quickly became my job. 
               I have been lucky enough to travel the world over through skydiving. My father was an IT professional, 
               so I have been exposed to the IT industry my whole life. I speak English and a little bit of Spanish.

                  IT has always been a part of my life! As a child I always had a computer thanks to my father, 
                  So I guess you could say he is my inspiration to be here now and looking to make this career change. 
                  IT became necessary as I progressed through my Skydiving career. Social media marketing, brand 
                  representation and upholding an internet presence as a whole became more prevalent and required, 
                  I thoroughly enjoy getting creative with both content creation and programming although 
                  I am still only a beginner.

            <p>My name is Lynn Su Wai, 32 years old and was born in Myanmar (Burma). I came to Australia in 2010 for further study. I live in Dubbo which is a regional area of New South Wales and work full-time. At my current work, I sometimes have to participate in assisting IT and Operations work, then it has become my interest in the IT industry, especially Networking and Programming in Telecommunication Industry. I love to spend my leisure time by watching Japanese Anime and watching movies.

                  <h2>Lynn - Interest in IT  </h2>
   
               <p>While I was studying in Sydney, I lived in a shared house. It was allowed only and most were Burmese people. In our teenage years in Myanmar, we did not have knowledge of technology and IT stuff. Since I have a bit of a hobby of fixing laptop and electronic things, they used to come to me when they faced an issue, such as manufacturing drivers, printers, and routers. However, it did not make me study in IT yet. After I got my full-time job, most of my colleagues are working in IT and Operations in my company. When we are on break, I have to help them with their works. I began to understand and be interested in how IT plays a role in most of our lives and the ability to apply IT is unlimited.

            <p>My name is Angeles. I was born in Chile, moved to Switzerland when I was 10 and later to Australia when I was 16. 
               I speak English, Spanish, and French fluently. While I was living in Switzerland, I tried to go for my 4th language
                and moving to the German-speaking side of the country on my own. 
               I did not realise the many different dialects that the German language has, and I ended up learning a specific 
               type of Swiss-German. 
               I have always had a passion for art and technology, and I did a graphic design diploma when I finished 
               high school. I thought it would allow me to have both combined. 
               I have had the chance to work in the industry for 2 years now. I decided to study IT because I knew that 
               I wanted to upgrade my skill set. After some time, I concluded that UX design was a great path to follow for me.

               I'm a Melbourne based IT student with a passion for languages and beauty. 
               My dream is to help make global communication via language learning a more accessible 
               and fun process. Native English speaker with some experience in Mandarin, pursuing Thai

                  <h2>Alwyn - Interest in IT  </h2>
   
               <p>My first introduction to IT was through my family's long running interest in computers, my own interests
                   remaining passive as I grew up. The catalyst from passive to active interest was through speculative fiction
                    of the 90s on how technology would have advanced to today, particularly Serial Experiments Lain. 
                    Throughout my late teens and early twenties my interest turned into a full-on spark, 
                    from working on a game development jam with a close friend to listening to my electronic music 
                    production teacher discussing how synthesisers and the work of Wendy Carlos has affected 
                    the creation of music to this day.

            <h2>Rabeed </h2>

            <p>
               I was born in Bangladesh and moved to Australia when I was 8 years old. 
               At the time I primarily spoke Bengali but was rather fluent in English too 
               as I had grown up playing games and watching films that were in English. 
               It was a also a requirement at the school I attended to speak English at all 
               times as well so that we could learn the language easier so that definitely helped 
               with the transition as well. I still speak Bengali with family as well as English. 
               So far to date I have completed my high school studies here, graduating from Macquarie
                Fields High School after transferring, and currently undergoing my tertiary studies. 
                Aside, from that I really enjoy gaming during my spare time, a good single player 
                game can take up hours of my time on a good day. I also love cars as well, 
                and the feeling of driving, something that I can’t quite put into words.

            </p>

        

                  <h2>Rabeed - Interest in IT  </h2>
   
               <p>My interest in IT sparked primarily from gaming. Growing up playing video games back when I was young
                   and comparing how much the technology and processing power of computers from then to now astonishes me. 
                   Especially, graphical fidelity within games, one of the reasons why I love playing single player games is 
                   because in those games I can set all graphics settings to the highest possible and see how good the game 
                   actually looks since higher frame rates are not required in these scenarios.

                              The developer is expected to work with other developers

                              This position will be challenging as real time payment processing requires fast response time and a 
                              high expectation of uninterrupted service, in order to ensure smooth financial transactions. 
                              Any service breakdowns will cause huge financial loss to the client and significantly reduce 
                              customer satisfaction. The developer is expected to be a team player who works with 
                              other IT professionals in the company.

                              and colleagues that have worked at start-ups and it always seems up beat and a great place to 
                              learn new skills as you are closer to the development cycle of the products I feel. I have also 
                              been working in the finance industry on the side and as such have come around the term Fintech 
                              quite a lot. This is also an area that I wish to explore and learn more about since I already 
                              have experience within the finance industry albeit minimal.

                  <h3>IT Interview - Christine</h3>
                  <p class="info">Data Analyst / Data Miner <span>&bull;</span> <em class="date">Jan 2022</em></p>

                  <p>
              NetIt Solutions interviewed Christine who is a Data Engineer, who has works for the Australian Federal Government for 12 years. Christine was asked several questions to help NetIT Solutions understand what a Data Engineer does.</p>
			  
<p>As a Data Engineer, Christine mostly works with very large data sets, Christine does a lot of analysis, data mining and reporting. Che also manipulates data to fit the way she needs it be able to report on. Manipulating data is used to extract data from different systems and those different systems have different formats for recording the data, Christine manipulates the data to merge all data sets and to ensure that the formatting is consistent with the data store.</p>
<p>As Christine works for the Australian Federal Government, she was unable to elaborate on some of the questions that we asked her, as there is a level of secrecy that she needs to uphold with her position.</p>
<p>Within her position with the Government, Christine must manage people, create apps and dashboards for her clients so they are self-sufficient, as they request the same data time and time again, the dashboards and apps streamline the data they need. Although Christine doesn’t make the app, she does have a lot of input for what the apps need to accomplish and how to prepare the data for input into the app.</p>
<p>Christine works with a range of people within her IT profession. There are a lot of technical people as well as political people, senior executives, data scientist, and data engineers. Christine doesn’t interact with the general public very often; she mostly responds to freedom of information request from people that are asking questions that relate to how the data is being used under the freedom of information act. Christine does however provide information from the apps, dashboards and data sets to different government agencies if she receives a memorandum of understanding.</p>
<p>The IT professionals that Christine work with are Data Analysts, Data Engineers, and IT support. they work together to extract data form legacy systems and cleanse data and add them to SQL to ensure the data is usable. Data cleansing is used to verify the information included in the data sets is accurate, by checking individual records to ensure that there were no system or human errors, Data cleansing is what most of Christines team do.</p>
<p>The clients and investors that Christine interact with as Senior Executives, other business areas within her department and ministers. When parliament is sitting and someone asks the minister for Christine’s department a question, they will receive questions on notice, which means that Christine’s department will need to find the answer to the question so that the minster can answer the questions that the government have asked them.</p>
<p>Christine spends most of her time managing the 25 staff members that work with her team, she manages the staff that are underneath her as well as the staff above her. As the team Christine works in manually check the data there is a lot of human error, Christine needs to engage the staff members that what they are doing is wrong and how they can improve from their mistakes so that they don’t have to cleans as much data. Christine also manages the data stores, where they use SAS, to deal with large data sets. The large data sets they use have mostly millions of rows of data, some have billions, which her team are responsible for manually checking to ensure that there are no errors in the data sets and why she spends most of her time managing staff members.</p>
<p>Christine finds that managing staff is the most challenging aspect of her work. Other areas that she finds challenging is the different systems that she gets the data from, these systems are not very compatible with each other. How the data is stored also has its challenges, know what programming language that are being used to store the codes for the data stores, the languages that Christine mostly uses are, SAS, BASE, R is used or shiny apps, some Java and HTML, and a bit of Python. </p>
<p>The essence of the work Christine’s IT work is creating apps, so the shiny apps that are used to extract data from the different systems and puts it all into a tidy place. Streamlining the process asking for the data by creating the dashboards and app where all parties can access the same information for different reasons.

                  <h3>IT Interview Zahid</h3>
                  <p class="info">Senior Buisiness Analyst <span>&bull;</span> <em class="date">Jan 2022</em></p>

                  <p>
                 NetIT Solutions interviewed Zahid who is a Senior Business Analyst, who has works for the Australian Federal Government for 10 years. Zahid was asked several questions to help NetIT Solutions understand what a Business Analysis does.</p>
As a Senior Business Analyst, Zahid is a part of a team that develops new applications for the government. Zahid must work out the business requirements, the design aspects, designing universal modelling language diagrams, creating flowcharts, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, entity relationship diagrams and creating technical documentation for the new applications.</p>
<p>As Zahid works for the Federal government there is a level of confidentiality that he must adhere to, the industry that he works in takes the law and or government system and interpret the legal changes into systems.</p>
<p>The other work that Zahid must keep legacy systems up to date, use modern technology and ensure they don’t fall apart, work in migration projects, and talk to clients about what requirements they need for applications and exploring domains to see what needs to be improved for existing systems.</p>
<p>The people that Zahid interact with varies depending on the project that he is working on. Most days Zahid works with the other Business analyst in his team, as well as programmers, a scrum master for daily meetings, product owners for dictating the requirements of what is being built, architects, program managers who look after funding and other areas that are looking for help.</p>
<p>Working for the government, the term clients and investors is not the same as it means in the private sector, as the department that Zahid works in does not reach out to the public, all the clients are internal stakeholders who work for the organisation, they understand the law very well, and understand the process of particular government schemes or programs. Zahid doesn’t have much to do with those that issue funding, that is the role of the program manager.</p>
<p>Depending on what he is doing, Zahid spends most of his time doing different thing. At the time of the interview, Zahid has been spending most of his time completing documentation, writing and designing systems, as well as talking with various stakeholders, architects and product owners. This documentation is to ensure that everyone in the team is on the same page.</p>
<p>As a senior Business Analyst, Zahid finds that time management is the most challenging part of his work, he is copied into all emails that anyone in his team wants. Being in a leading role, prioritizing work is also a challenging as Zahid must interact with everyone.
Making sure that everything works well when something is built, and has been thought through so it isn’t created twice is the essence of the IT industry that Zahid works in.

			      <h4>Crypto Currency</h4>
			      <p>Blockchain and Crypto currency
                  Crypto currency in its rawest form is a digital asset based on a network that is distributed and controlled via a network of computers. The structure if this network is decentralised which allows crypto currencies to exist outside the control of governments and central authorities such as banks.<br>
                  
                  Blockchain 
                  As its name suggests a blockchain is essentially a set of connected blocks on an online ledger. A block is made up of transactions that have been independently verified by each member of the network. Every new block generated must be verified by each node making it essentially impossible to for transaction histories. The contents of the online ledger must be agreed upon by the entire network of an individual node, which provides an unmatched level of security.
                  
                  Blockchain technology can be utilised by many industries for a variety of uses, some examples of this are supply chain technologies, online voting, crowd funding, and banking applications just to name a few.<br>
                  
                  Some types of crypto currencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Xrp, Ripple, Solana, Enjin, Mana and many more, each crypto currency provides solutions / function. For example, Mana (Decentraland) is a coin that facilitates purchases of all types in its metaverse, Xrp is used to facilitate transfers by banks between different geographies.
                  
                  Satoshi nakamoto created Bitcoin, it went “online” in 2009. BTC remains the most widely traded and covered cryptocurrency to date. As of November 2021, there were 18.8 million bitcoins in circulation with a total market cap of around 1.2trillion dollars. There is a cap of 21 million bitcoins to ever exist meaning the value will continue to increase.
                  
                  Due to bitcoins amazing success and the obvious solutions blockchains offer, many other cryptocurrencies have been launched, known as alt-coins (some listed above ). Some of these are clones or “forks” of bitcoin while others were built from scratch. By November 2021 the aggregate value of all crypto currencies had reached 2.1trillion – BTC  represented approx. 41% of that total value.
                  
                  Fiat currencies are a crypto currency that has its value pegged to that of a standard currency E.g USD , pound etc<br>
                  
                  As of December 2021, El Salvador is the only country in the world to allow bitcoin as legal tender for money for monetary transaction.  Jurisdiction in regard to crypto varies the world over.  
                  
                  Cryptocurrencies are distributed / sold on a variety of exchanges like that of a stock exchange. Some examples of crypto exchanges are binance, kucoin, crypto.com and a variety of brokers the world over. Crypto currencies are also often sold via the company’s website, especially before they are approved for exchanges such as binance etc.<br>
                  
                  Cryptocurrencies are generated by mining. Mining is a process that involves downloading software that contains a partial or full history of the blockchain and confirming future transactions which is rewarded in a small payout of the cryptocurrency you’re mining.
                  
                  Crypto currencies are an alternative to our current monetary system.  The goal is to streamline existing financial architecture to make it more efficient, while taking the control away from institutions such as banks and returning it to the masses.
                  
                  Blockchains and the crypto currencies operating throughout them have the potential to transform well established financial institutions and bring lower costs, faster execution of transactions, improved transparency meaning total reform to our financial sector. 
                  
                  Blockchain will reduce the massive duplication of information that creates delays, conflicts and confusion in many aspects of financial services, for example, when a syndicate of lenders participates in a loan, having one shared ledger means they don’t all need to be tracking the ledger independently. International’s payments and corporate stock records
                  Are examples of financial areas with huge inefficiencies because of record duplication.
                  
                  It is entirely possible that in years to come we will see private businesses implementing their own private blockchains to improve the transparency and traceability of their financial operations, supply chains, inventory management systems and other internal business systems. 
                  
                  Blockchain is destined to create profound changes in almost all industries, for example blockchains will instantiate massive changes to health care, doctors’ clinicians and facilities will have better access to health records without location being a barrier. The transportation industry will see changes to the platform sued to track time, date and condition removes delivery charges for things like delays and damaged products. Retail and manufacturing companies can expect to see changes to the way they respond to consumer demand and could track provenance products. Once implemented blockchain will provide the ability for clear proof of origin for the oil and gas industry, eliminating all black-market concerns among other dubious sources and concerns. Possibly most excitingly blockchain has the ability to remove a lot of the anonymity surrounding governments making the day-to-day actions of our politicians more transparent.
                  
                  As blockchain becomes more and more of a staple for our modern world, your average human is more and more likely to be interacting with blockchain style technologies on a day-to-day basis. As we have covered above blockchain is destined to cause massive e reform to almost all areas of our lives providing less anonymity to the “powers at be” and less of a veil for them to hide behind. The good news is you wont necessarily notice a difference in how you perform most functions that are destined to be reformed in the future. For example, validating a contract in the future will work a lot the same way, however the way that information is stored will be reformed with the use of blockchain technology making it safer and more transparent for everyone involved. 
                  All in all I think its extremely likely that blockchain will be affecting almost every part of your life in one way or another in the not so distant future.

		      <div class="description-box">
			      <h4>Cyber Security</h4>
			      <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems by adding multiple layers of protection spread across computers, applications, data that one or an organization wish to keep confidential. The technology in its current state is viable, however the majority public are not educated enough to implement these measures in our day to day lives. ASCS report produced by the Australian Cyber Security Centre reports cybercrime increased 13% over the 2020-21 financial year and the cost of cybersecurity and losses involved have also increased. Most organizations, as well as smaller business, has however, made cybersecurity a priority over 2021. The pandemic is the primary cause of this response as most organizations and business had to employ digital strategies in order to continue operating. This has ranged from setting up employees among various organizations with their own devices which came with all the latest VPN services and protections in line with cybersecurity to ensure no data would be leaked from these devices while they were out of the organizations reach. As well as businesses enrolling online websites for their products and ensuring there to be a up to date privacy policy making their customers aware of what data was being collected as well as ensuring that the securities in place among the website and the POS systems are secure enough to not have their data leaked. </p>

<p>It is best to continue the education and provide more resources and avenues to help implement cybersecurity among organizations, businesses and the general public to avoid further increasing losses of monetary amounts as well as sensitive data. The ASCS have already taken this step in publishing various alerts and advisories on the cyber.gov.au website which in itself had seen over 7.8 million traction and they continue to publish step by step guides to assist older Australians and smaller businesses, and they also provide exercises to organizations to strengthen their cyber resilience. This should be the primary goal over the next few years as the world is thrust into a more digital age, as society I believe is not aware of the private data that may have already been or can potentially be leaked and unfortunately by the time we do become aware, it is too late. People need to be more educated in the different privacy policies that are enrolled among different organizations and businesses. And even more important for these organizations to ensure that they don’t lose their customers’ data due to negligent cybersecurity measures. </p>

<p>AI and Machine learning have played parts in the advancement of cybersecurity. Such as Deep Learning being used to track logs, transactions and real-time data to find a threat within a network, by learning to spot patterns and signaling the potential attempt of an attack. This also falls in line with behavioral analytics which is stored and then reviewed for any patterns or habits among the users of the network. A baseline is set through organizations and any abnormal increase to data transmissions allows to identify a possible threat to the network. Blockchain is another advancement aiding cybersecurity. Blockchain itself is presented as a decentralized system with no central server. It allows each participant to have an updated copy of a large register, thus making it transparent, and traceability is easier as the logs can be checked by any member. Furthermore, hardware authentication has also made it harder for breaches as technology generates a unique code which then requires used input as well as the initial password in order to access the data. This is often referred to as 2 factor authentication and has been widely adopted to increase security among user accounts.  </p>

 

<p>Educating society on cybersecurity in this digital could potentially reduce the losses involved in data breaches and leaks. It can ensure that large organizations and businesses and the general public don’t lose monetary value or even go as far as sensitive personal data stolen. The more resources available to educate on the current technologies available in terms of cybersecurity can potentially allow society to be more open to new innovations as they will feel safe knowing there are parameters in place to protect themselves in case something does happen to fail. These measures being taken early can save organizations and people alike time and the sensitive data they store. This applies to all new innovations as mentioned such as AI and Machine Learning as well as Blockchain as secure as that may be. Without these measure, these technologies unfortunately will become redundant and possibly never used as society feels it to be unsafe to their sensitive data. </p> 

<p>As such, further education is required for everyone in order to effectively implement these new innovations. Blockchain is still rather new but has picked up traction, primarily with NFTs which in itself also has cybersecurity measures in place in order to avoid duplication of copyrighted items. Furthermore, AI and Machine Learning is already an area of skepticism. Primarily since people are not very confident with a technology potentially having the ability to think and learn on its own, even if it is employed to simply pick patterns within a network to identify threats. This is once again, due to lack of knowledge in the technology. With further education and implementation of these new technologies, it can also branch off to creating more job opportunities as there would be more people qualified to service these new technologies as they come, as well as new study options for both domestic and international students within various countries.</p>   



<p>As someone who likes learning about new innovations, I believe these new technologies will have a positive impact in my life. With the advancements in cybersecurity, I can have peace in mind no matter where I am within the digital space. It will allow me to keep my work and personal items separate as they will be on different networks each with its own security protocols in place. It will allow me to create more digital spaces with my family where we all may be able to interact with each other, knowing that any information shared within that space stays within said family. AI and Machine Learning is a particularly interesting area to see how broad that technology can be in terms implementation given that this technology can be implemented to learn on its own to detect threats better. Blockchain, I will be honest is an area I lack knowledge in but that reinforces my point in the importance of education for these new technologies even more so that people understand what they are using. Transparency is key, as I am sure myself and many others – my family and friends among them – would hate to be in the scenario where data you did not know was being collected in terms of “protection” only for it to be leaked as a result of a breach due to one of these new technologies failing, thus creating distrust. I personally have had experiences with family members who would refrain from receiving information through digital means as they were under the impression that it would not be secure and that sensitive documents that would be sent digitally could be accessed by phishers and potential data breachers. Hence a direct example of fear due to lack of knowledge with the technology.</p>

			      <h4>Cloud Services</h4>
			      <p>
                  Cloud Services
“Cloud Services” refers to a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. these applications are designed to deliver services to the user in an and affordable way, while removing the need for internal infrastructure or additions hardware. Whether its checking email or collaborating most people are using cloud services in one way or another even if they aren’t aware of it. Cloud services are provided by vendors and service providers, they are made available to customers from the service providers servers, meaning there is no need for a company to assume the overheads of hosting its own applications or services etc on its own on premises servers.</p>

<p>Public cloud services are services that a provider makes available to numerous customers over the web. The SAAS – Software as a service, IAAS – Infrastructure as a service and PAAS – Platform as a service are all examples of public cloud services. The ability to share resources is at scale is one of the biggest benefits to public cloud services. This allows organisations to offer more capabilities with less over heads then conventional methods.</p>

<p>Private Cloud services are services that a provider does not make generally available to corporate users or subscribers. Apps and data are made available through the organizations own internal infrastructure with a private cloud services model. The platform and software serve one company exclusively and are not made available to external users. The private cloud model is utilised by companies that work with highly sensitive data such as those in healthcare or banking industries, which allows them to leverage advanced security protocols and extend resources in a virtualised environment.</p>

<p>There is an arrangement where both private and public cloud services can be combined to form a Hybrid cloud environment. This arrangement is mostly utilised when the user / organisation needs to store sensitive data in a private cloud, but also requires employees to access apps and resources in a public cloud for day-to-day communication and collaboration.</p>

<p>SAAS
Software as a service, A very broad category which includes a wide variety of services. File storage and backup, web-based email, project management tools are all part of the SAAS line-ups examples are Dropbox, Gsuite,Microsoft Office 365, slack etc. in each of these applications users can access, share, store and “secure” information in the cloud.</p>

<p>IAAS
Infrastructure as a service. IAAS provides the infrastructure that many cloud service providers need to manage SAAS tools. IAAS supplies the complete datacentre framework, removing the need for on-site installations. Examples of IAAS are AWS, Microsoft Azure etc. these providers maintain all storage servers and networking hardware, also offer load balancing, application firewalls and many more features depending on the service chosen. Many well-known SAAS providers are run and maintained on IAAS platforms.</p>

<p>PAAS
Platform as a service. PAAS provides a web based environment where developers can build cloud apps. PAAS provides a database, operating system and programming language that organisations can use to develop cloud based software, without maintain the underlying elements.</p>

<p>Cloud services are often provided on a monthly or annual basis which removes the requirement for software licencing for on premise machines, removing the need to invest in onsite infrastructure and equipment. Also greatly increasing flexibility as services are implemented in an on demand, as-needed basis meaning the business can cancel the subscription or shut down the service with little no outlay and minimum cost to the customer.</p>

<p>Cloud computing has had a profound effect on the world, as a direct result of cloud computing / cloud services remote work has become not only a possibility but coupled with the pandemic a total reality for a lot of people the world over, without cloud services this would be a lot less possible. Another key area cloud computing has greatly affected is cost reduction, because resources can be so widely spread the ability to spread cost means greatly reduced cost for everyone involved, and as a direct result high end programs / services are more widely accessible.</p>

<p>Another key benefit to cloud computing and how it has transformed the way we use tech is its scalability. scalability is the key benefit to cloud technology as the client has the flexibility to scale up and scale down the resources as per its requirements.</p>

<p>Cloud computing’s flexibility has seen it once again mould the text industry, slowly transforming it into the futuristic tech industry we are currently in, thanks to the flexibility cloud computing offers the average customer or user is free to decide which services they want to use and pay for. </p>

 <p>Cloud services are being used to support social impacts, even involved in reducing carbon emissions. The impact of cloud computing in our day to day lives varies but is very prevalent, some examples of how cloud computing affects us. Social media, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, twitter etc all use the cloud in one way or another IE the pictures we upload are all stored in the cloud. Entertainment  industry has been completetly overhauled with cloud computing , where we would before go and rent a dvd, buy our music in cd format etc etc  now we directly stream our entertainment. Netflix , amazon, spotify, etc all utilise  the cloud. Even the way we shop has been revolutionised by the cloud with ecommerce companies like Amazon , Flipkart etc also employing the cloud. Doctors offices establish cloud based portals where important health data is accessible. Universites offer courses online via learning materials, stored in the cloud.</p> 

<p>In conclusion the impact of cloud computing is almost everywhere, it’s a  remarkable revolution that continues to shape our world.</p>

			      <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
			      <p>Machine learning is the training of computer programs such as algorithms, using collections of data called datasets, to 1) construct a model for a problem and 2) make decisions about the problem, often without further human intervention. </p>
<h5>What does it do? </h5>
<p>A state-of-the-art example is a probabilistic model for recommendations called SVD++, which is a new algorithm to recommend products to customers based on usage and personal profile, called a recommender. A recommender is a beneficial aid for customers to shop because it will increase the likelihood that people find the product they want, which leads to them buying and thereby increasing revenue. This is most often used in e-commerce and streaming services settings. </p>

<p>The field of machine learning has vast and important applications in many industries, especially in fast decision making in financial, banking and insurance. The technology is a marked improvement from earlier programs written based on fixed business rules and logics; since the algorithm learns from datasets to derive its own rules, the rules evolve with the dataset the algorithm over time. The following are some current applications:</p>


<p>1.	Fraud Detection
Machine Learning is extensively used in banks for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions, by preventing suspicious transactions outside of the customer’s daily spending patterns from going through. </p>


<p>2.	Credit Scoring
Machine Learning algorithms are employed in loan assessments, evaluating risks of loan applicants based on their profiles to produce a credit score, in order to reduce future loan defaults. The financial institution can also choose to be lenient with non-performing loans, by helping customers with good credit scores to restructure their loan obligations instead of taking more drastic measures such as foreclosures.</p>


<p>3.	Email Spam Filtering
Spam messages are mass irrelevant messages that cause unnecessary clogging of email inboxes. The purpose of spam filtering is to improve user experience by filtering out spam messages into a different folder. Many intelligent spam filtering systems are now using machine learning algorithms to detect spam messages by learning the patterns and style of previous spam messages, instead of simple phrase or word matching used in the past. </p>


<p>4.	Transport Planning
Machine Learning can be used to plan out a traffic network, by learning data from traffic patterns from different days and times of the day. The datasets of vehicles and people movement are learned by the algorithms to produce a model that establishes existing patterns, so that it can be used by the planner to reduce wastage of service capacity in areas not likely to generate traffic. A model can also be constructed to simulate the future traffic scenarios for comparison.</p>



<p>One important future application of machine learning is training algorithms in full self-driving vehicles. The algorithm will be trained with 1) on-road datasets collected by various sensors such as the fast-developing radar technologies to determine immediate response to different road situations, and 2) aggregate traffic pattern data to predict current traffic so as to determine fastest routes that increase overall fuel efficiency (a climate change target). This will require all vehicles to submit data rapidly to a central cloud, therefore a 5G network or above is necessary to support this kind of fast data transmissions in real time. Road tests from private corporations in China and the US are already underway.</p>

<p>Another piece of technology to enable full self-driving vehicles is the use of quantum computers in machine learning that could significantly increase the speed of the algorithm’s processing and response time. Quantum computers are still being developed but they are predicted to be many times faster than classical computers in certain problems, and the enormous data from the sensors uploaded to the cloud will require a very fast algorithm to respond in reasonable time. 

<h5>What is the likely impact?</h5>
<p>The enormous impact of machine learning is already felt in many workplaces and homes, and it will continue to be the case in the years to come. The world is being empowered by faster decision making based on real data to solve hard problems, using the ever improving CPU speeds and sensor technologies. The increasing coverage of data collection means that more problems can be solved without human intervention. The need of human workers in some workplaces will be replaced by the decision making abilities from machine learning algorithms.

<p>In work situations where many workers are needed to assess information to form good business decisions, machine learning will greatly reduce the number of human workers needed as decision makers. Human workers will be placed higher in the work hierarchy to deal with more complicated problems, or simply random check on the decisions made by algorithms. The faster and lower cost decision making means that the bank or financial companies can reduce the overall cost in providing services and shorten the response time by using credit scoring models, which will in turn increase profit margins. </p>

<p>The use of a machine learning model has a higher cost to businesses initially, but the long term running cost is much lower than sustaining an employee. The people who have a low educational skill set, and perform streamlined repetitive tasks are going to be redundant first, businesses will create more positions for workers who can deal with more complicated situations, and jobs requiring more creativity or human touch to the solutions.</p>

<p>Positions for engineers, data scientists and machine learning specialists will be in much higher demand in the foreseeable future. They are the major pillars to create, maintain and improve the machine learning systems in many applications in different industries. Bank tellers, loan officers, insurance claim assessors will be redundant because their job will be mostly replaced by the algorithms. This is already happening in Europe, where many rural bank branches are closed to save costs, customers are streamed into online services where they are being served by machine tellers (aka chat bots).</p>
<h5>How will this affect me?</h5>
<p>
The rise of machine learning will definitely speed up many decision making processes in my daily life: 1) Better purchasing decisions, based on my previous purchases, a recommender will help me be better informed about, and find, the items I want to purchase, in a tailored and efficient manner, 2) Better user satisfaction, when the algorithm can understand my preferences from studying the purchase history and personal profile, I feel more satisfied in buying online, 3) Shop online more frequently, because the online shops are easier to navigate and the algorithms help with my decision-making, this will greatly reduce the need for shopping trips in physical malls and the anxiety in explaining my preferences to a salesperson.
</p>
<p>

I imagine that life will be different for me in domestic and work situations where the use of machine learning will disrupt the existing order in numerous ways: 1) My trip to work will be a much better experience when fully self-driving vehicles become a reality. With an automated navigation system powered by a machine learning algorithm, I won’t need to worry about handling traffic and deal with the stress of driving. I will arrive at work on time and be refreshed, rather than tired. 2) My work experience will also be affected. Instead of low level programming, I will gear towards employing Machine Learning techniques to solve problems by collecting datasets and using the algorithm to make a decision. The fundamentals of my work will elevate to a much higher level of expertise; a problem solver rather than just a computer programmer.  

</p>
<p>
My family and friends will also be affected by machine learning technologies, as they will use smarter automatic shopping algorithms to receive delivery regularly. With the IoT (Internet of Things) revolutionising home tech, many home appliances (such as fridges) will be installed with advanced sensors to collect data necessary for machine learning. The algorithm will work out when the stock level in the fridge is low and send a restocking order to the householder for their approval. People can focus more on enjoying life at home rather than spending time on shopping.

Although all our group members were finalised after 9th of January 2021 in Assignment 2, we managed to complete our Assignment 2. Since Assignment 2 was our first group assignment, we struggled a bit with using Microsoft Teams, GitHub features and functions. There were a lot of files uploaded in Teams Channel to combine each member’s work. In Assignment 3, we were more familiar with utilising technical tools, and tried to manage more meetings and communications between members. To avoid the time delay of sharing each member's work, combining and sharing back again to get approval from each member, we use google document this time for Assignment 3. We found that our members are more active, organized and friendly while we worked together in Assignment 3, although we all had our own personal issues arise throughout the period to complete the assignment, we all pulled together to help each other complete sections that were not completed within the time frames set.

			<b>Nathaniel</b>
			<br>
			My career plan and objective is to gain a role at the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in the penetration testing area. This role is responsible for testing the different applications that are used on the website to conduct the census. In order to get into a role of penetration tester at the Australian Bureau Statistics is to continue to study the Bachelor of IT at RMIT focusing on the Security Information Management, as this forms an important part of the role. Once I have completed the Bachelor of IT, the next course of action would be to gain experience with penetration testing, this can either be done via an internship or work placement. As penetration testing is a branch of cyber security, being able to think from a criminal's perspective is an important part of the role as well as keeping uptodate with all the methods that are being used to attack symptoms and be on the continuous lookout for trends and potential trends that could be used in the future.

			<b>Enoch</b>
			<br>
			Enoch’s career goal is to create a technology startup company because of the possible financial independence in working for himself.  Working for others are temporary steps to reach the ultimate goal of working for oneself, so after graduation good first jobs would be the ones in the areas of database management and payment. They provide a good level of job stability and relatively good remunerations; unlike software development which requires moving from one project to another, database management is the backbone of a company’s computer infrastructure where the team usually stays. Payment systems are critical to business operations and experienced professionals are constantly in high demand. The stability and good pay will allow Enoch to gain more practical work experience and a good professional network, while also improving his financial standing to gather the initial capital for a start-up.<br>
			The proposed technology start-up will require the Bachelor of IT as one of the credentials that Enoch can use. But trying to create a startup right after finishing the Bachelor of IT would not be a wise decision, as Enoch needs to gain some more skills in the IT industry in order to better understand how a technology start-up works, and he also needs to research for a good idea for a startup. As the startup will be related to the payment industry, he will start with an internship (already doing) and move on to a junior database programming position later on. After that, in order to be a database scientist or data analyst, he would also be looking to augment his knowledge of SQL and data analysis, perhaps through industry certifications and short courses.  Meanwhile, Enoch will also be looking out for research opportunities in graduate studies in Quantum Computing and AI, as they are somewhat new, with unknown potential. The experience will form a solid foundation for an AI technology startup company using quantum computers.

			<b>Thomas</b>			
			<br>
			My major goal is to secure flexible remote work. Because of this I have begun my studies here at RMIT with the aim of completing a bachelor's degree in IT. I really like the problem solving and creative thinking side of programming coupled with its remote work and flexible working hours capabilities, I believe this is the pathway that suits me best!  My career plan is to continue studying IT through RMIT with a focus on mastering Programming fundamentals and not only languages but also the art of learning languages quickly and efficiently. Once my studies with RMIT are complete I will look to move into a junior developer role with the hope of gaining experience in working as part of a development team, expanding my portfolio and gaining invaluable industry experience. As I grow into the role of junior developer I will seek to continue growing my skill set in order to expand into the role of senior developer. As a senior developer I will need to have a deep understanding of databases and application services (queues, caching etc) and obviously be comfortable working on any area of an app.

			The most common elements in ideal jobs of our groups are being a team player and having a good communication skill in general skills. In technical skill, most IT companies are looking for employees who have proper programming skill but the other skill will be focused on which direction of the position will be led.  <br>
			Software engineers will be focused on their skill in a variety of coding languages and the other technical skills of Computational linguists will be sounding analysis tools, Unicode and IPA. The additional skills for UI/UX designer are visual design and wireframing and prototyping. Apart from programming skills, Cyber Security Advisor will also require penetrating and data manipulation skills.  Network Engineers will need to have networking skills and be familiar with other varieties of networking equipment and wireless technology.<br>
			My ideal job is Network Engineer and programming skill will be necessary as other roles in our group’s members. In my current company, I work with vendors, doing documentation for our department, and field engineer for CPE devices and some routers. However, I lack networking and programming skills which could lead me to reach a higher position or career success. I plan to learn from both my work and this RMIT course which can help me to achieve this goal. The interesting fact of my job description is that the role will need to participate after business hours in on-call roster.

			<b>Alwyn</b>
			<br>
			Ideally, I'd like to pursue a career that allows me to scratch the linguistics fascination, while also allowing me to use my skills gained in IT to help people with similar interests to both learn and enjoy languages.<br>
			Teaching machines to better process and understand how languages work will help better streamline and identify the process that goes into learning a language. Therefore, I hope my career path will someday lead me into becoming a computational linguist (Schubert, 2014).<br>
			But as that is a lofty, far off goal that requires much study, I'd like to work as a backend developer and/or QA tester on the many wonderful projects that work to better understand and teach languages.<br>
			As my experience in IT is limited, and I will be doing a lot of studying for the next several years, I believe pursuing QA testing and working with smaller projects on the backend will be beneficial to both my education and to better support applications and such that do not have as high a backing and/or funding.

			<b>Rabeed</b>
			<br>
			My ideal path I would have to say would be some sort of developer or graphics/UI/UX design. As I have said I have always been fascinated with the way technology has developed and one thing in particular that really stood out over the years was the increase in graphic fidelity. As a result, to be able to develop something - a game, software, app, etc. - during this time of innovation would be a dream come true. <br>
			Although, I would have to say that some people I know have recently asked me to look into cyber security as that is a booming sector currently - understandable considering the amount of sensitive data is transferred - definitely another option ahead that I look forward to delving deeper in.

                  <h1>Overview</h1><br>
				  
				  
                  The RPG will have a focus on sentence mining, learning vocabulary and grammar in the context of full sentences rather than single word vocabulary.
                  Starting out, battles with enemy characters can be overcome with simple translation. The enemy will say something in either English or the target language, and it’ll be the player’s job to select the correct response via multiple choice answers. If correct, the user will receive a reward in the form of in game currency, an item, or even the enemy becoming playable. If the user selects the wrong answer, a battle will begin.
                  Eventually, it will switch from translation to selecting the matching sentence in the target language. For example, instead of translating the sentence ‘where is Tom?’ the correct response will be to select ‘Tom is at home’.
                  Tatoeba, a sentence and translation database under various Creative Commons licenses, will be used to build the base API. </p>
					
					<p>
                  <h4>Topic</h4>
				  
				  
                  This Role-playing game (RPG) is a game for learning languages and will focus on learning vocabulary, grammar and eventually constructing full sentences. The user will select native language and target language before the game starts. The story is based on battle fields with a hero character who eliminates enemies one after another in a road map. To complete each landmark in the road map, about 50 sub-levels need to be achieved successfully.<br>
                  In the beginning of the battle, the game will be designed to use a translation method to overcome the enemies then it will include a response method. When the translation method is used, an enemy will start a conversation in native language, the user has to select the same meaning of target language among multiple-choice answers. This method will change into a response method eventually and instead of translating the sentence ‘Where is Tom?’, the correct response ‘Tom is at home’ has to be selected.<br>
                  When the answer is correct, the enemy will be killed and the reward will be given as game currency or an item. If the wrong answer is selected, the player will be killed. 10 questions will be included in each sub-level and if you achieve less than 70% the questions have to be repeated in the same sub-level.   <br>
				  </p>
				  <p>
                  <h4>Motivation</h4>
                  There are various reasons that people are interested in learning new languages such as hobbies, job, travel and further study in different countries. Our RPG game will be used as both educational and entertainment tool for learners to be interested in their learning more and having fun at the same time.<br>
                  The learners can play our game anywhere around the world as long as they have internet access. Unlike going to language classes, they can play on the bus, train or travel around the world without any trouble and stress. It would be more beneficial during this pandemic period when everybody is locked down and restricted to travel both local and international. They can relax and learn new languages by playing our game.<br>
                  This project is focused on different skill levels of languages from beginner to advanced level of languages and the game can be played by any ages, however, our priority range of age is from 18 to 30. In addition, the wide range of customers in both gaming and education markets would be beneficial and bring remarkable profit for investors or shareholders.<br>
				  </p>
				  <p>
                  
                  <h4>Landscape</h4>
                  It is true that it is not an unusual game to be seen in gaming and education markets. There are a lot of online games related to learning languages. Some examples of learning games’ type are crossword, scrabble, vocabulary and grammar. The competitors in the gaming market which have very similar ideas with our RPG games are Influent, Earthlingo, Monster Phrases, Falling Clouds, Conditional Sentences and Slime Forest Adventure.<br>
                  The features of most games in the market are very limited. For instance, some games are boring and they are not attracted visually by seeing square blocks all the time and filling in words, some can only practice grammar, and some can learn only vocabularies. Most language games are available only in English and people who would like to learn different languages other than English find it difficult to have even an educational tool. The difference of our game is that the player of our game can learn grammar, vocabulary and the players will be able even to make conversation and communicate fluently in their target language.

                 <h1> Detailed Description</h1>
                 
				 <p>
                 <h1>Aims</h1>
                 Creating aims for a language learning application can be difficult, as many people will seek out our product for various reasons at various points in their language learning journey.<br>
   
                  Broadly speaking, the end goal is to provide an introductory and supplementary experience to beginner to intermediate learners. While it will not take you from zero to fluent, a vague concept in of itself, it will hopefully bring our users somewhere between A2 and B1 as outlined by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).
				  <br>
                  While we don't plan on making this solely a product for school age learners, both students and teachers will likely benefit the most from this product as the integration between teaching and technology becomes more common in the classroom (Navarre, 2018).
				  <br>
                  Teachers may also benefit from using it to better understand what vocabulary their students have gained, especially those who do not share the same native language as their students. Even those who aren’t educators in a language may benefit to learn basic vocabulary for the sake of ESL and equivalent students (Tichnor-Wagner, Parkhouse, Glazier and Cain, n.d.).
				  <br>
                  At its current state, Digital-Game Based Learning (DGBL) is not quite up to snuff to fully teach a language in of itself, but more research needs to be done in order to prove its level of effectiveness and it is commonly agreed that it, at the very least, help supplements the language learning process when it comes to classroom and solo study environments (Loewen et al., 2019).
				  <br>
                  Expanding on this, we will have a focus on catering to the market of Gen Z and Millennial language learners as they'll likely benefit from and connect best with the format of a language learning RPG.

                  <h1>Plans and Progress</h1>
                  NetIT Soulouts was to embark on the learning adventure of building a Role Play Game that was to enhance the players' learning of different languages. This was to be done by creating different enemies that when interacted with would produce a sentence or phrase that needed answering, if you answered correctly you would defeat said enemy and progress through the game. The first levels of the game would be gaining a basic understanding of the chosen language so that the player could move to harder phrases that need to be answered, for example the first ten levels or enemies would be learning colours like blue red or green then move to household items like television, telephone, fridge and computer. After learning the translations of beginner words, the enemies would then ask the player questions that use the beginner words for example “What is the colour of my shirt?” the response would be “blue” in the target language that has just been taught.<br>
   
                  A lot of the past five weeks was spent researching how to best build the Role Play Game. We have looked at using different application building programs and software but none were suitable for use in what we were hoping to achieve for the task of getting at least one level completed. During the research of finding what platform was best, when we found one we would test what we could do with the app. We followed an interactive tutorial for Build Box to try and create a game, but this was not an effective way of trying to build a game to learn a language and more for games like Colour Switch. After learning how to use the program that took a week with watching videos and completing tutorials. This process was the longest part of trying to create the game we needed to submit to complete the assessment.<br>
				  <img class="progress-pic"  src="images/progress1.jpg" alt="" />
				  <img class="progress-pic"  src="images/progress2.jpg" alt="" />
				  By the time we found a suitable application, Figma to build the game we had reached week 12 and were unable to complete any levels or codes. Building a  role play game has proven to be very difficult to complete in 6 weeks, there were alot of time restrictions and uncertainties for what we needed to complete and times to complete them.
				  <br>
				  We decided  that the engine used to develop our game will be Unity. Our decision came after comparing the cost and performance of both similar game engines and building our own. It's also cross-platform, allowing us to avoid the lengthy process of fully porting our game to multiple operating systems on both desktop and mobile. Optimising for lower-end hardware is also much easier because of this.
				  <br>
				  It also has a personal licence available for free, allowing us to work on the project at no fee until we receive 100K USD in either revenue or funding within 12 months.
				  <br>
				  There are a plethora of games already created with the engine, of various genres and mechanics. The flexibility to create the systems we need in game is one of the most important pros.
				  <br>
			      However, the software is not without its cons. Knowledge of C# is required along with time dedicated to learning Unity's UI. Due to the flexible nature of the engine, it will take time, along with trial and error, to discover the best way to implement our mechanics. Taking a course will mitigate this, and the pros vastly outweigh the cons.<br>

                  <br><br>
                  <h4>Software and Tools</h4>
                  First, we are going to test on our own personal computers for a demo before launching an RPG game. Once it has completed and ready to deploy, we will use Amazon Web Service (AWS) Amazon Elastic Computing Cloud (Amazon EC2) which can provide the secure and resizable desired server we want. Amazon EC2 can provide:
				  <ul class="bulletpoints">
				  <li>Virtual computing and network environment</li>
                  <li>Preconfigured templates of Operating System (OS) with customised CPU, memory, storage and networking capacity</li>
                  <li>Key pair for security login connection</li>
                  <li>Compatible to use with Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)</li>
                  <li>A customised firewall that allows protocols, ports and the range of IP addresses</li>
				  </ul>
                  We also planned to get Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes as our cloud storage that can be mounted on Amazon EC2 and formatting and partitioning as we want. AWS DynamoDB service will be used to backup and restore our EBS storage service.
				  <br>
                  All of our team members are young students and the investment of infrastructure and Virtual Hardware machines are out of our budget range. Therefore, we have decided to use AWS so that we do not need to worry about utilities, installation, building rental fee and security.
                  <br><br>
                  
				  
				  <h4>Security & Client Privacy</h4>
                  It is important to be aware that we need to tighten our security as we are creating an educational RPG and we use Amazon Cloud Services. Amazon will provide us a key pair which is a set of security credentials that consist of a private key and public key to access our Amazon EC2 service. This set of key pairs is very hard to be cracked by hackers but we need to save our private key in a secure place since Amazon will allow anyone to connect who has the key. We are required to specify the key whenever we try to connect Remote Desktop Connection to our Window Server. Our Company Policy is to keep the key in an encrypted zip file and every member needs to delete the extracted key after they use it each time.
				  <br>
                  Unnecessary protocols, ports, and IP addresses will be disabled on the firewall device and all company data would be encrypted. Keeping operating system and anti-virus software on both server and each member’s laptop is one of our company policies to follow.
				  <br>
                  Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) framework will be set up to protect IP traffic on the network layer. IPsec performs initiation, (Internet Key Exchange) IKE phase 1, IKE phase 2, Data
                  transfer and termination to create the tunnel. IPsec can provide the following features:
				  <ul class="bulletpoints">
                  <li>The data will be encrypted and only sender and receiver can be read.</li>
                  <li>The sender and receiver can be able to check if someone makes the changes to the packet.</li>
                  <li>Both the sender and receiver can check that the desired device is talked by authentication.</li>
                  <li>IPsec prevents sending duplicate packets if a hacker captures the encrypted and authenticated packets and sends them again.</li>
				  </ul>				  
                  Hard Drive that stored our data could be damaged for several reasons such as temperature, corrupted file,virus, weather and so on. It is crucial to keep backup and disaster recovery
                  schemes from outage for several reasons, we are going to use Amazon DynamoDB
                  Backup and restore service. This service will offer On-demand backup data storage, Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) data storage and Table data restored space.
				  <br>				
                  Nowadays, data breach happens even in well-known companies and causes serious harm to both company reputation and consumers. Therefore, every member, especially, people who take responsibility for cyber security should read and understand Privacy Act 1988 on the Federal Register of Legislation website. Consumer data will be confidential and collecting data from consumers will be permitted only when it complies with Privacy Act 1988.
				  <br>   
                  There are also a few factors that need to get attention by employees with regard to cyber security. Here are the causes of potential damage to our company security and employees should avoid.
				  <ul class="bulletpoints">
                  <li>Installing third party software from external resources such as USB, external HDD, and websites</li>
                  <li>Connecting to the company network from VPN via public wi-fi</li>
                  <li>Downloading files, folders and images from first time or infrequent senders</li>
                  <li>Leaving username and password as default or blank on laptop and network equipment devices</li>
                  <li>Partial Drive Encryption </li>
                  </ul>
				  
                  
				  <h4>Funding</h4>
                  The expenses are divided into two parts, monthly expenses and one time expenses.
                  <br>
   
                  <img class="funding-pic"  src="images/expense2.jpg" alt="" />

                 <h1>Roles</h1>
                 <p>As a group we have decided not to define roles as we are not actually developing anything, rather just working 
                                 together as a team to present the most detailed report we possibly can essentially at this point of the project
                                 we are all researchers trying to gather together enough information to prove our project is a viable option in 
                                 the real world. Therefore defining a UI designer or Lead programmer is not a possibility as based on our current
                                 level of experience in the IT field we simply do not have the experience / timeframe / budget to actually present 
                                 any results. Instead we are working as a team to systematically work through the Assignment 3 requirements by breaking

                              Below is a basic list of some necessary roles that would be required if a project like this was to gain funding 
                              and be successful in the real world:<br><br>
   
                  <h4>Project Manager: </h4>
                  A project manager is required for planning and overseeing the project. The project manager will be there from the beginning of
                  the project all the way through to completion. The project manager will coordinate people and processes to ensure we stay on 
                  budget and achieve our desired outcome on time.<br><br>
   
                  <h4>UX/UI Developer:</h4>
                  The UX/UI designer is required to ensure the team's vision for the user interface is achieved. 
                  Areas of focus for the UX/UI dev will include:
				  <ul class="bulletpoints">				 
                  <li>Content</li>
                  <li>Controls</li>
                  <li>Visual Design and development</li>
                  <li>Information architecture</li>
                  <li>Branding</li>
				  </ul>
				  <br>
   
                  <h4>Linguist:</h4>
                  As an educational RPG with the aim of teaching people a new language a linguist is required to oversee the implementation of 
                  not only the specifics of how we apply this learning aspect to the game but also to ensure that we achieve the highest possible 
                  level of education through this game.<br><br>
   
                  <h4>Software Engineer:</h4>
   
                  A software engineer is absolutely necessary for a project of this nature. The software engineer will be required to analyse 
                  and modify the application as its being built design. Constant design work will be required along with constructing and testing 
                  as we continue to grow this project into a reality. All of which will be by utilising a variety of programming languages.<br><br>
   
                  <h4>Security Manager:</h4>
                  It will be paramount that we can ensure that data provided by our users is kept secure. The security manager will be in
                  charge of ensuring that security threats are kept to a minimum through constant proactiveness.<br><br>
   
                  <h4>Sub contractors:</h4>
                  A variety of sub contractors will be required at different times throughout the process of bringing this amazing idea to reality. Some of those include:<br>
				  <ul class="bulletpoints">	
                  <li>Additional language experts depending on the language we are branching out and adding langauges</li>
                  <li>Developers all though we have a software engineer, there will be times the work load will be too much so we will need to bring in sub contractors to meet deadlines</li>

                  <li>A variety of lawyers including copyright, patent, business and tax lawyers</li>
                  <li>Graphic designer we may want to bring in additional graphic designers at times to meet deadlines</li>
                  <li>Testing professionals</li>
                  </ul>
				  <br>
				  <p>
                  <h1>Scope and Limits</h1>
                  The proposed project will focus on learning languages in the form of a RPG (Role Playing Game) game that will be a
                   mobile or online app. It involves a battlefield with a hero character, landmarks roadmaps with 50 sub-level, 
                   and each sub-level contains 10 questions each.These questions are related to the meaning of the target language 
                   users wish to learn.<br>
   
                  The goal for our initial demo for the app will have at least one landmark roadmap for one language complete by
                   the end of 15 weeks. That starting roadmap can be a template for other languages that we will expand in the future. <br>
   
                  Each sublevel consists of specific learning outcomes that will guide the storyline and control the language 
                  content with strategies to achieve these outcomes.  The initial scope for the project is to provide language 
                  lessons at the A2 standard, as defined by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).  <br>
   
                  The goals of the A2 level are:
				  <ul class="bulletpoints">
				
                  <li>“Can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance 
                  (e.g. very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment).</li>
   
                  <li>Can communicate in simple and routine tasks requiring a simple and direct exchange of information on familiar and routine matters.</li>
   
                  <li>Can describe in simple terms aspects of his/her background, immediate environment and matters in areas of immediate need.”</li>
				  </ul>
   
                  Aiming at the A2 level will help the development team towards the goal of providing an introductory and 
                  supplementary experience to beginner to intermediate learners.<br>
   
                  The proposed language coverage will initially focus on English and Chinese. Being the most commonly used language 
                  in the Western media and the world, many people globally are willing to pay a substantial amount of money for 
                  English language learning programmes. With the rise of the economic power of China, Chinese is rapidly becoming 
                  a sought after language to many in the West who are interested in conducting business in China. We will eventually 
                  expand into other languages as well in later releases. Our next languages will be based on demand for the 
                  language, as ascertained by a poll on our website, which will guide our on-going product development.

                  <p>
                  <h1>Tools and technologies</h1>
                  First and foremost we will need to create a website, in order to create a website we will utilise HTML,CSS and 
                  JavaScript. We will also require a social media presence so accounts will be required on Facebook, Instagram, 
                  Tiktok and Twitter. Github will be utilised to ensure the ability to collaborate effectively between developers. 
                  Furthermore cloud storage will be a must once the game is fully developed, IBM offers secure commercial solutions. 
                  Advertising via google, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, SEO, Blogging influencers, Government initiatives and relative brands.  <br>
                  
                  Depending on if this project materialises as a 2D or 3D game, there are several free and paid software and assets 
                  that may be used. For 3D, the Unity Engine or Unreal Engine are available to use for free
                  with no royalties for $100,000 USD annually and the first $1,000,000 USD earned respectively. 
                  Unity can also be used for 2D software.<br>                 
                  
                  
                  For 2D, Game Maker Studio 2 has several subscription models available while the multiple versions of RPG 
                  Maker only cost an upfront fee for the software with free assets available in all versions and
                  even a basic character sprite editor is later iterations.<br>
                  
                  Vocabulary will be gathered based on the websites and software listed in the overview.<br>

                  <h1>Testing</h1>
                  As our demographic will mostly be comprised of Gen Z and Millennial, mostly due to the project being both a game 
                  and appealing to people just starting to dip their toes in language learning, alpha and beta testing will comprise 
                  mostly of people between the ages of 18-30. Experience in video game QA would be appreciated, but not a necessity.
				  <br><br>
   
                  Glitches in the overworld and game functionality will be as prioritised as issues with the language component of 
                  the project. They are far too intertwined to ignore one over the other.<br><br>
   
                  As the sentences used in the project will be taken mostly from Tatoeba, an open source sentence database with 
                  entries submitted by native speakers, hiring native speakers in every language supported will likely be unnecessary 
                  in the long term. As sentences in the user's native and target language will be shared among users, odd sentences
                   will likely be caught regardless.<br><br>
   
                  For example, a native Hindi speaker learning Korean can report oddities in Hindi sentences in early gameplay.<br>

                  <h1>Risks</h1>
                  Major risks associated with RPG language learning projects are manageable if planning and preparation are given 
                  adequate considerations in advance. The following are some of the more specific risks associated with the game 
                  development and deployment in a start-up context.<br><br>
   
                  <h4>Financial Risk Against Project Completion</h4>
                  In a start-up context, cash flows and capital raising are one of the first and most important considerations. 
                  Many great projects failed before even reaching the intended audience due to the shortfall of capital during 
                  development to move the projects to completion. Our team acknowledges the relatively small budget available to 
                  fund this RPG language learning project, and our ability to withstand disruptions is limited. Suppose if we run 
                  out of money before the project is finished, it will be discontinued and our stockholders will be demanding
                   their money back. <br><br>
   
                  To mitigate this risk, our team will be exercising due diligence in budget planning, monitoring and preparing 
                  contingency plans so that our project remains financially viable against a moderate amount of disruptions. 
                  Like fashion, the industry of game development has specific trends and technological advancements that contain 
                  an essential element of time. The RPG Language Learning project, if overly delayed, can go out of fashion and 
                  become difficult to market. For this reason, the priority of different components in the projects will be identified, 
                  so that the core functions will be retained and deployed quickly when a disruption occurs, 
                  while optional features can be rescheduled for later release if necessary.<br><br>    
   
                  <h4>Language Risks as a Quality of Work Issue and Change of Language over Time</h4>
                  An important aspect of RPG games centered around language learning is the quality of work in implementing 
                  different languages. The impact of poor quality of language implementation is a crucial factor that affects 
                  the success or failure of this project, i.e. the app is doomed if the quality of language implementation is not 
                  up to standard. Users will discard the app if they are constantly led into confusion and low ratings will further
                   increase the uptake risk (more on that below). The way to mitigate this risk is to construct a thorough
                    test plan and to use human testers to test whether the implementation is presented to them effectively.<br><br>
   
                  Another language risk is associated with the evolving nature of language over time. Every year new vocabulary 
                  is introduced to English and other languages; word sense changes over time. The challenge is to maintain a 
                  built-in language update mechanism so that the intended audience will not find the app completely useless to 
                  them after a year or two. There are language update lists issued by research institutions each year that could be 
                  used as a reference for language changes over time, and the use of native speakers as testers and initial
                   developers will also help to mitigate this problem. A word sense map can be constructed using web scraping 
                   technique to maintain a constantly flowing data to update the ongoing word sense change automatically
                    (preferably executed as an AI robotic program).<br><br>
   
                  <h4>Uptake Risk</h4>
                  The uptake risk is plainly the questions of 1) how many people are going to download the product, 
                  and 2) how many use it for learning. If the app does not function, or is poor in content, the uptake 
                  (how many people will buy it) of the app will be problematic and users will dump it quickly to focus on other 
                  products. The impact will be a diminishing market share, and being marginalized by competitors in the competitive
                   language learning market; the app might quickly disappear, even if we bring something to the table in the first
                    place. This is the life-and-death factor that determines the survival of the app. A way of mitigating the 
                    uptake risk is to plan and conduct extensive user experience tests and implement journey optimization
                     recommended by user experience and interface experts. <br><br>
   
                  <h4>Cyber Attack Risk</h4>
                  The RPG language app we are developing will be open for anyone to use, i.e. a large audience with a wide range
                  of backgrounds. At the same time, it also means that the web server is vulnerable to open attacks, e.g. ransomware, 
                  Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. If our server becomes hacked and private personal information is leaked to the 
                  public domain, our reputation will tarnish and the customers will leave for competitors. To mitigate this risk,
                   we will follow industry best practices for security and get our security check by cyberattack experts.<br><br>
   
   
                  <h4>Response Time Risk - Responsive Web Server Issue</h4>
                  Our team expects the RPG language learning app (our web service) will become very popular over time. As the 
                  uptake rate rapidly increases, our server may become slower and slower, as more people are accessing it
                   simultaneously. This is an issue particularly relevant to an app with users relying on slower internet 
                   connections from different countries. If our server becomes too slow, it will impact user access, resulting 
                   in loss of customers which will potentially jeopardize our market share. To mitigate this risk, we will have a 
                   plan to monitor the server load, and upgrade the server if necessary. We will also be conducting user surveys
                    and monitor performance issues across different users with varying speed of Internet access. <br><br>
   
   
                  
                  <h1>Skills</h1>
                  We will need to have proficiency in the following areas to make this project come to life; coding, graphic 
                  design, UI/UX design, audio design, animation, AI modelling, scripting, production. We will also need a game 
                  engine to actually run the game on such as Unreal Engine. We need to also ensure that the game would be optimized 
                  for a broad range of machines with different specifications. There would also need to be a network administrator 
                  maintaining the servers that we would need to use to push OTA updates periodically with new features and bug fixes. 
                  The feasibility of these requirements is definitely in our favor considering the time. The hardware availability 
                  is quite broad so finding a host server or running our own would not cause many hurdles. Most software’s such as 
                  engines are also open source which also broadens our choice. In terms of the skills required, there are plenty of 
                  online platforms on which to learn the skills required to make this project a reality, such as skill share or Lynda.com. 
                  <br><br>
                  
                  <h1>Outcome</h1>
                  While no language learning application or software can ever truly teach someone the full extent of a language 
                  from zero to fluency, our product will hopefully serve as a valuable resource to help supplement and motivate the language learning experience.
                  Better yet, with the current stagnation and oversaturation of extremely simplistic gamified language learning
                   experiences, we hope that our product will pave the way into more innovation and experimentation when it comes to methods of teaching a language.
                  It will also, hopefully, help to relax the language learning and polyglot community’s rather strict views on 
                  what is and isn’t learning. Inefficient yet popular, stale language learning is the norm among the elite, despite 
                  the contradictory science.  Acquisition of a language is quicker and more efficient through exposure in media, 
                  having tailored made experiences that are also enjoyable are a much needed and underutilised market.
                  Helping to set the standard by creating an accessible, easy to understand, and effective product is the true long-term goal.
                  Language learning should be for everyone, global communication should not be gatekept or watered down to such 
                  a degree that it’s ineffective. That is the outcome we at NetIT wish to make a reality.<br><br>
   
                  <h1>Group Processes and Communications</h1>
                  Within NetIT, our communication between members was quite open and meetings were flexible in terms of attendance
                   as all meetings are recorded for anyone that may have not been able to attend, or even for anyone that wished to 
                   go back and rewatch for notes. The frequency in which we upkeep these meetings were usually every 1-2 days apart 
                   including some short progress updates over weekends so as to not take up each other’s time. The tools we put to use 
                   involved Microsoft Teams as our primary communications tool, along with Google docs to collaborate on the same
                    document where everything is open for anyone to edit if in case a member has skipped over anything someone 
                    else would come along and fix it. Overall, with a bit more fine tuning, the aim is to make this method more 
                    efficient in keeping track of who is on what task - adding names next to specific topics that those members 
                    are undertaking in the Google Doc was a good start.

               <b>Group Reflection</b><br>
               Our team started with two initial active members, Nathaniel and Enoch, then Thomas joined in week 5 and four more members (Angeles, Rabee, Lynn and Alwyn) joined in week 7. The project goes well as Nathaniel has been an excellent coordinator with admirable talents in editing the paper and setting up meetings. He communicates well and demonstrates good leadership skills. Strong leadership is the determining factor in driving the success in team projects. All our group members are keen and helpful, trying their best whenever they are asked.<br>

Enoch has been receiving feedback for the website from the tutor. He authored the discussion in machine learning and provided the initial drafts of the ideal job’s skills table and the group reflection report. Thomas suggested the name of the team and constructed the website, the GitHub repo, in addition to sound contributions during the meetings. The other group members made an effort to contribute to meetings as well, with Lynn doing editing work on the paper, Alwyn contributing their insights into the selected project idea, (which is his idea); due to the limited time since they joined us, we look forward to getting to know them better in the next team assignment. <br> 

In hindsight, we should have had the team finalised a week earlier so that we had more time to get to know one another, but given the circumstances, we achieved the best result we could, and overall, we feel positive about the team working experience. We will start early and implement better time control in finishing tasks in the next assignment. The tasks being allocated could be communicated better with clear deadlines and someone to follow up if necessary. <br>

Another process that could be improved is how changes are made to the report. Currently Nathaniel incorporates every major change into both the website and document, which leads to a bottleneck until Nathaniel has time to incorporate everything. Next time we should use version control tools more extensively so that everyone should edit the document with their changes, preferably on GitHub, and then the editors can work on the completed document right away.<br>
 <br><br>
               
             
              
               
               <b>Nathaniel</b><br>
               It has always been a pleasure with this group. Everybody has come together to help everyone out. Our communication has improved since the start of the semester, everyone that was still active in the class came to as many meetings as they could, it is understandable that not everyone can make the meetings as they have their personal lives to contend with. As a group, we need to improve our decision making skills, especially when it came to trying to find a program that was most suitable for building the game, asking for input will be a hard task for our group in the future. I do hope that the group stays in touch after the completion of this semester of studies as I believe that we could still learn and grow from the different experience that the team has.

               <b>Lynn</b><br>
			   I have enjoyed working in this team with everyone. In spite of our team members having difficulties for several reasons such as personal issues, work and different time zones, we tried to contribute as much as we could for the assignment and presentation. We organised at least two or three meetings per week to catch up, update progress, and discuss what to do before the next meeting. When team members could not attend the meeting, we watched from the recording of the meetings and discussed in the group chat or next meeting. We are getting familiar and spoke out our suggestions and ideas openly. While I was working in this team, I learned that every person has different skills and we could achieve our goal quicker when we worked as a group. We found that we need much technical skills to improve for stepping into the IT field as a professional and studying in RMIT was the right decision that we made to improve our skills.<br><br>
			   
			   <b>Alwyn</b><br>
			   I'm honestly impressed at what our group has accomplished over the past term. Though many of us had issues outside of the course, we did our best to work around them for the sake of each other. We all committed to the best of our ability and for that I'm very proud, even if I know we could have gotten a better fina result had we been able to plan ahead more. I do wish we'd better communicated when something had come up, but that's a flaw that I see within myself the most. All in all, I think we all did our best with the resources and time we had available and I hope we have a chance to work together in the future.

			   <b>Rabeed</b><br>
			   It was once again great working with this team. There were a lot of personal issues, I know I definitely had a hard time juggling the times to meet up and work, but in the end everyone pulled through and were able to complete their parts. It was great that we had meetings so frequently even if all members could not be present - as the meetings were all recorded - so it made it easy for everyone to keep up to date with what areas they need to focus on and what everyone else’s objectives are in regards to the development of the game. It was also very efficient, to see different members proactively taking topics that they knew about so as to get it done as quickly as possible. Everyone stuck to their strengths and it was great to see everyone helping each other out in that sense.
