<h1>Interview with Business Analysis Zahid</h1>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> <span style="color:#808080">[00:00:00]</span> Okay. I'm here with Zahid who works for working it with a federal government department. Just so you know, I am recording this. Do you, do I have your permission to use this for my assignment? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> Oh, good. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Awesome. So today we're going to talk about what you do in it. So basically just start off, tell us about your work.</p>
<p>What exactly do you do?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> So, um, my current job title is a senior business analyst. Um, I'm part of a team that is developing a brand new application for the federal government. Um, my day-to-day activities is literally, uh, figuring out business requirements, uh, and then making, uh, designs force, uh, for the new system that we're creating.</p>
<p>Um, and to do that, I might need to, I might be in the hazing, we have a lot of stakeholders, um, drawing various UML <span style="color:#808080">[00:01:00]</span> diagrams or, uh, technical documentation. Um, but yeah, it's, it's never the same. It really depends on the part of the project you're on as to exactly what work you'll be doing. Um, so yeah, it's, it varies a lot depending on where we're up to and what would.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Okay. You mentioned something to get U D L UDM </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> UML</p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> UML diagrams. What are those? So if you can speak about them, I do know that you do work for the federal government. I do know that secrecy is a part of your job. So if you can elaborate, could you please?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> Yep. So, uh, UML diagrams aren't anything specific to the government that it's UML is universal modeling language.</p>
<p>Um, so, uh, these are things like flow charts, um, swim lane, diagrams, business process, diagrams, sequence diagrams, and entity relationship diagrams. So, um, and they all serve a purpose. <span style="color:#808080">[00:02:00]</span> Um, so your business processes are quite obvious. Um, you know, you do a certain process and depending on that come, they might be.</p>
<p>So, depending on the decisions you go either one way or another, um, it's just a very convenient way of documenting all of that to everyone's on the same page, um, sequence diagrams and stuff like that, that defines, um, uh, how the different various applications interact with each other and what sequence the, the, the invoke each other, essentially, uh, </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> excuse my ignorance, but is sequenced like SQL and non-SQL.</p>
<p>Or am I thinking something totally different? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> Um, no. So SQL doesn't really have much to do with sequence diagrams </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> ok, ok, ok I am drawing two different lines. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> Imagine like system interaction. So you might have system made that needs to talk to system B and then depending on something you might need to talk to consistency and it's just drawing that flow in the diagram, so it can <span style="color:#808080">[00:03:00]</span> visualize the entire end to end process for a particular action.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Yeah. Okay. Now I get ya. I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> What else? So, uh, uh, a class diagrams. So I'm not sure if you're familiar with object oriented programming or anything like that, but </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> not yet. Um, hopefully by the, then the next semester, I'll know a little bit more about programming. Yeah. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> So class diagram sort of define, I suppose, the easiest way to understand it is that it it's a group of data that relates to something.</p>
<p>So a class diagram would be like to say, You might have a client class, which the properties in that client class might be like, you know, name, age, date of birth, and all of that jazz, um, which might have a relationship to your pets, which is another class, which might have a name age and whatever else.</p>
<p>Right. Okay. Um, and you need to draw these diagrams because, uh, the system is generally built, <span style="color:#808080">[00:04:00]</span> uh, based on that structure. Um, and the interactions between the systems that are also based on those. And it also allows you to further develop that into what's called an entity relationship diagram, which is mainly used for your databases.</p>
<p>Um, so if you have application, let's just say, you know, your person class with your name and stuff like that, that needs to be actually saved into a database. And the entity relationship diagram will show you. You know, the entity, which is a person and the various attributes that entity has, which has your name and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Um, and how all of that gets saved into a database, the structure and all of that. So, you know, your name. Yeah, it'll be more familiar with this one. You get into programming, but your name, you know, it has a dialogue type of string and it might have a maximum length of like 100 characters or something like that.</p>
<p>So all of that stuff goes into an entity relationship diagram. It also <span style="color:#808080">[00:05:00]</span> shows you the relationships between classes. So, you know, if you might, it might be like a person owns a pet. Has a dog bowl or item was something, a you or whatever else. it shows you all of this relationships. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Okay, cool. So please tell us about the industry you work in.</p>
<p>I do know that you do work for the federal government, as you said. So earlier when we were organizing this interview, like just elaborate as much as you can, without giving away any secrets or any sensitive information that you can. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> Okay. So obviously, as you mentioned, I worked for the federal government, um, and.</p>
<p>Without going to specifics. The, what we do is essentially we take the law or we take a government system. And if the law changes, we have to then interpret the legal changes into whatever system that we have. <span style="color:#808080">[00:06:00]</span> So, um, as an example, let's just say, uh, tomorrow with the tax rate changes for individuals, um, which might mean may mean that we need to go into our system and change the values accordingly so that people get taxed properly.</p>
<p>Um, or if, if, uh, the government suddenly needs to send out a recent example would be the COVID stimulus payments. We need to change our system to give up those. I suppose the monies to the relevant people figure out if they're eligible or not. Um, so yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's mainly just, uh, I suppose, implementing the government's will.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Okay. </p>
<p>so basically taking what they say in parliament and making something physically change. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> Yes, basically. Um, that, that would be the, I think that would be one side of what we do. So what they say in parliament and make the physical change, make sure. Um, and the other side of it is also taking the existing systems and <span style="color:#808080">[00:07:00]</span> make making sure that they don't fall apart.</p>
<p>You know, um, and the government, we would have a lot of legacy systems that are in, that were built 10, 20, 30 years ago. Um, and we often need to just, you know, just make sure that they are kept up to date. They use modern technology and whatever else. So, um, we call this migration projects, um, Th that would be the other half of what I kind of do.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Okay. </p>
<p>That would fall under what other kinds of work that you do right there? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I'm in kind of like, I feel like as a business analyst, your work isn't really defined, you're kind of the person that does what needs to be done regardless of what your job title says. I mean, what your job description might be.</p>
<p>Um, so yeah, one day I could be. Developing a new application or designing an application the other day, I could be like, you know, working on some migration project and the next day I could have nothing to do with <span style="color:#808080">[00:08:00]</span> it. And I literally have to talk to clients to figure out what, you know, what requirements they have, or even just exploring the domain to see if anything can be improved, um, in any of the existing system.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Okay, </p>
<p>thank you. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> Okay. So, um, the different people really depends on, um, the team or the project that you're working on. Um, but in general, um, we, uh, we implement what's called the lean agile methodology for our. Um, and that has, uh, certain stakeholders involved.</p>
<p>Um, so starting off with your team, um, in my, in my team, for example, I have, uh, two other business analysts that I interact with on a day-to-day basis. I have three, uh, programmers that I interact with and, uh, to test is, um, <span style="color:#808080">[00:09:00]</span> w w we test, 'em what we make, obviously. Yeah. But in addition to that, I also have to deal with a, uh, scrum master who does the daily stand-ups and, um, takes care of any issues.</p>
<p>Um, we also have a product owner who is responsible for dictating the, uh, requirements of what we build, um, design and build. Um, so that's my immediate things. Other people like sort of deal with everyday. Um, external to my team. We have architects, it architects that define, uh, the patterns and structures that we need to follow to make government applications.</p>
<p>Um, we also have like program managers that look off to like the funding and, um, I said it was funding and timelines and resources of the project. So, um, you know, the re uh, hiring and all of that. Um, and that would actually basically <span style="color:#808080">[00:10:00]</span> cover 99% of who I deal with. Um, and it just had half, sometimes add up people come up, come up to you for help from random areas, um, where you try to help out if you can.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Okay. </p>
<p>Um, that also answers the next question that I had, which was please tell us about your interactions with other it professionals, but you've just mentioned all those people that you do deal with on a daily basis. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> Yeah. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Um, what about your interactions with clients or investors?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> Okay, so being in the government, that's a, uh, the definition of our clients and our investors is a bit different to a traditional private it company.</p>
<p>Um, because we don't necessarily go out to the public to deal with the clients of the government agency. Um, uh, so. Our business. Our clients is actually our business stakeholders who are people that work in that in our organization that, <span style="color:#808080">[00:11:00]</span> that are not necessarily it, but they understand the law very well.</p>
<p>They understand the processes of, um, a particular government scheme or program very well. Um, so we generally talk to them to figure out what system needs to do. Um, just at a very high level. Um, That's the level of, I mean, if I think about it, it's almost like going to a, any client for any other it company, except our clients are internal.</p>
<p>Um, the internal stakeholders, um, as far as investors go, um, in my particular role, I don't have much to do with the people that. That provide funding, um, and stuff like that. Um, we have the program managers that sort of deal with that on trickle down, um, what they want the system to do, or any, any requirements that they may have.</p>
<p>Um, but yeah, I don't have <span style="color:#808080">[00:12:00]</span> any direct interaction with, uh, the equivalent, uh, investors. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Okay. What ex what, sorry, what aspect of your work do you you spend the most time on?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> Okay. So that, that, that's a, that's a tricky question in my role because, um, as I think, as I mentioned before, it really depends on what I'm doing. Um, so if, if I was to take, let's just say the last six months as an example, so I'm designing a brand new system. Um, and the majority of that time, because we're still in the early phases has been.</p>
<p>Doing documentation and talking to the various stakeholders such as the, it architects, our, uh, product owner, um, and whoever to come up with the requirements. So my major, the most of my time has been, has gone to documentation and writing and designing the system itself. Um, I think, you know, <span style="color:#808080">[00:13:00]</span> without going into the details, I think there's been about five or six different types of documentation that I've had to do.</p>
<p>Um, So that's been my primary focus, but you know, which if for some close second, um, second would be in my, in my role, I also had to sort of, um, define the work that my team needed to do. So as the designer, I sort of have a bit more say in what gets programmed or built first, um, and making sure that everyone in my team is on the same page.</p>
<p>Th the requirements and all the documentation that I've done. I also had to then elicit that to everyone in my team, um, to just make sure that everyone's on the same page and we're all trying to get to the same outcome. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Okay. Um, I've got a left field question for you. Technologies. What technologies do you use the most </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> technologies?<span style="color:#808080">[00:14:00]</span> </p>
<p>I could </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> if you can share it. </p>
<p>I know that it might be difficult. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> I like it. It's not that it's a secrete it's, it's, it's more, um, I suppose when it comes to technology and my role, it's the technology that the product that I'm designing is going to be built using because for my particular job, it's mostly talking to people and, and writing documents and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So, you know, all my day to day job, I use Microsoft word a lot or Microsoft excel. But in terms of the technology that the product that I'm designing would have built using, um, is that we will be deploying this on Amazon web services, AWS, um, the particular application that I'm working on, would they build using TypeScript, which is a more structured version of JavaScript?</p>
<p>Um, it's the easiest way to put it. Um, we use a framework called noJS. Um, which is a, which <span style="color:#808080">[00:15:00]</span> allows us to build a web service using TypeScript essentially. Um, other than that I know is that people around me are using a lot of Python, um, and Python. I know that there was a few.net components as well. So we do have some C-sharp components and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Um, And we will be also, we are also using Mongo, not necessarily Mongo DB, um, but a AWS document database and the closest, uh, no one sending them would be Mongo. DB. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Okay. Just thought you more that way. You're talking about different programming languages, which program, if you were to do programming, what's your preferred language to program in?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> Um, That's uh, that's interesting. Um, because for my particular job, I don't do programming, but I do <span style="color:#808080">[00:16:00]</span> have, uh, I have done that in the past and I do it as a hobby for some reason. Um, so I personally like, um, the thing, I think there's two that are the top contenders at the moment, either Python or C sharp.net.</p>
<p>Um, so. Both of those are both of this programming languages have their merits and disadvantages. Um, Python is very easy to write with if you know, it almost reads like English. Um, but it's also not the friendliest in terms of, uh, uh, just debugging and testing and stuff like that. And w when I say it's not the friendliest it's, it's relative to C sharp because in C Sharp everything is very structured.</p>
<p>It's it's, um, it's, what's called a strongly typed language, which means that you have to define everything that you're doing properly in a, with its proper, um, <span style="color:#808080">[00:17:00]</span> structures and such, which also make it very easy to, you know, if, if there's something that goes wrong, it's very easy to just go into the code and pinpoint exactly where something is happening.</p>
<p>Um, And it's supported by a very large company, Microsoft who make it very easy to like, you know, deploy and test to everything that you've done. Um, but yeah, they both have their uses. Um, you know, Python is great when I want to work on some AI or data science things. C sharpis great when I want to build a web service or a desktop application or something like that.</p>
<p>So. I think, I think the term is different horses for different reasons or something like that.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Horses for courses </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> and bingo that's the one. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Yep. </p>
<p>Awesome. Um, which aspect of your work do you find the most challenging? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> Most challenging. Um, right now I honestly have to say it's time management. Um, so being the senior BA in my, in my team, I <span style="color:#808080">[00:18:00]</span> do get, you know, CC'd into everything that anyone and anyone in my team ever wants.</p>
<p>And I personally find that I don't have enough time to go through and, um, go through and, uh, basically contribute to everyone's problems like in the seven hours and 30 minutes that I have in allocated for me. But, um, I think at my level though, I do end up working a lot overtime. So my days are around eight to nine hours generally.</p>
<p>Um, Yeah, I think, I think time management and just prioritizing work right now, it's been difficult just because I am in that leading role that I have to contribute and interact with everyone at the moment. So, yeah. That's my biggest one at the moment. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> What do you find to be the most interesting part of your job?<span style="color:#808080">[00:19:00]</span> </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> The most interesting.</p>
<p>It's going to be, it's going to be a hard one to explain. Um, so having worked in it for a long time, 10 plus years now, um, uh, certain things about how applications are built is to have started to, um, I suppose, pick my interest a little more. Um, so I come from a data background as well. So currently, um, I'm very much focused.</p>
<p>And, you know, it's kind of interesting for me to look at because it's going to impact a lot of my personal projects as well is how the different applications, uh, exchange data. Um, so, uh, as, as I mentioned, you know, in the thing that we're building, we have TypeScript, we have Python, we have C sharp and, you know, inside of a particular programming language, it might be quite simple to exchange data, but when you have multiple systems that are, you know, That are not even in the same platform <span style="color:#808080">[00:20:00]</span> trying to exchange data, it becomes very difficult.</p>
<p>Um, so, uh, for me right now, I think it's just figuring out the different patterns that we can use, um, to make those data exchanges happen. Um, and how to just make things more generic and, and break down those complex, you know, data structures that we have internal. Into something that can be communicated, um, across the various applications.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Okay, cool. And finally, can you share an example of the work that you do the best captures the essence of the it industry? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> Um, okay. Um, interesting question essence of the it industry. Um, so I suppose, you know, like going into. Uh, as someone that does the designing of the applications, it's it. I kind of pulled some parallels <span style="color:#808080">[00:21:00]</span> to, you know, how I used to work as a junior developer as well.</p>
<p>Um, which is that I, I think it's important to understand why we need to create all of those designs and specifications and not just go straight into coding. Um, So in my particular role, and I suppose the essence of what I do is making sure that everything works very well. And when we build something, we don't have to do it twice because it's been thought through.</p>
<p>Um, so yeah, I mean, so I kind of have to like the essence of it is that I have, like, I have to know a little bit about everything I have to know. How coding works. I have to know how testing works, how it's going to all integrate together. So I feel like, you know, in my particular role, I do have, have to kind of be across everything a little bit.</p>
<p>Um, <span style="color:#808080">[00:22:00]</span> which I, I mean, I sort of look at us, you know, the essence of what it is and just making sure that things integrate well, things, things don't go wrong. Um, and it's as efficient as possible. Yeah, I'm not sure if that was the right answer to that question because I'm not sure what the question is asking.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> There's a lot of thought there, and it is a very interesting role that you do being a business analyst. And from when, before we had this conversation, I didn't think that you don't so much with it, but now after asking you all these questions, the IT. Concept what you actually need to know about the, how different products are going to work together when building and writing documentation for those programs actually work.</p>
<p>There's a lot more it being business analyst than I thought there was. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> Yeah. It's certainly something that he can't really, um, see if you're outside of looking in, <span style="color:#808080">[00:23:00]</span> um, in a there's certain people that you would know that that, um, would say, I just didn't write word documents all day. The thought that goes behind writing those documents and, you know, it's like, why have I chosen to use this particular term or technology instead of something else?</p>
<p>That's really the essence of what I do. Like, um, it's like, I know my, my role is like a senior business analyst, but I think I do tend to, um, have my foot into in ITI architecture or data modeling and a whole bunch of other stuff. Um, just because the BA role business analyst role is so generic, you CA you do have the flexibility of, you know, going into all of those other areas as well.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Awesome. </p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time. Once again, I was speaking with Zahid and just to re-clarify that you are okay if I use this recording for my assignment at RMIT, </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> not a problem. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Awesome. Thank you very much for your time. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Zahid:</strong> Thank you.</p>
