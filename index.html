            <h2>Nathaniel </h2>

            <p>I have spent nearly 15 years in the hospitality industry. with a strong background in gaming. 
               I have been a duty manager in a few clubs around Canberra. While working in clubs I also owned 
               and operated a small cleaning business for 6 years. I specialised in domestic cleaning but also 
               had a few commercial contracts. During January of 2020 I decided to resign from my full-time role 
               as Duty Manager so I could focus on building the cleaning business so I could sell it. 2 weeks after 
               I resigned from the club I managed to become fully booked and started working 6 days per week, 2 weeks 
               later we were hit with the pandemic, resulting in the sudden loss of 90% of my customer base. After trying
                to keep the business afloat for two months, I made the hardest decision of my life, which was to close the 
                cleaning business indefinitely. After the business closed, I decided to try and up skill by enrolling into a 
                Bachelor of Management. I have completed three units at a university level with a high credit average to date.

            <p>My name is Angeles. I was born in Chile, moved to Switzerland when I was 10 and later to Australia when I was 16. 
			I speak English, Spanish, and French fluently. While I was living in Switzerland, I tried to go for my 4th language and moving to the German-speaking side of the country on my own. 
			I did not realise the many different dialects that the German language has, and I ended up learning a specific type of Swiss-German. 
			I have always had a passion for art and technology, and I did a graphic design diploma when I finished high school. I thought it would allow me to have both combined. 
			I have had the chance to work in the industry for 2 years now. I decided to study IT because I knew that I wanted to upgrade my skill set. After some time, I concluded that UX design was a great path to follow for me.

                              The developer is expected to work with other developers 
                              and analysts as a team. Secure APIs will also be developed to access the payment system, 
                              and message queues will be used to process the high amount of real time payments that will take place. 
                              This position will be challenging as real time payment processing requires fast response time and a 
                              high expectation of uninterrupted service, in order to ensure smooth financial transactions. 
                              Any service breakdowns will cause huge financial loss to the client and significantly reduce 
                              customer satisfaction. The developer is expected to be a team player who works with 
                              other IT professionals in the company.

			      <p>Blockchain and Crypto currency 

Crypto currency in its rawest form is a digital asset based on a network that is distributed and controlled via a network of computers. The structure if this network is decentralised which allows crypto currencies to exist outside the control of governments and central authorities such as banks. 

 

Blockchain  

As its name suggests a blockchain is essentially a set of connected blocks on an online ledger. A block is made up of transactions that have been independently verified by each member of the network. Every new block generated must be verified by each node making it essentially impossible to for transaction histories. The contents of the online ledger must be agreed upon by the entire network of an individual node, which provides an unmatched level of security. 

 

Blockchain technology can be utilised by many industries for a variety of uses, some examples of this are supply chain technologies, online voting, crowd funding, and banking applications just to name a few. 

 

Some types of crypto currencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Xrp, Ripple, Solana, Enjin, Mana and many more, each crypto currency provides solutions / function. For example, Mana (Decentraland) is a coin that facilitates purchases of all types in its metaverse, Xrp is used to facilitate transfers by banks between different geographies. 

 

Satoshi nakamoto created Bitcoin, it went “online” in 2009. BTC remains the most widely traded and covered cryptocurrency to date. As of November 2021, there were 18.8 million bitcoins in circulation with a total market cap of around 1.2trillion dollars. There is a cap of 21 million bitcoins to ever exist meaning the value will continue to increase. 

 

Due to bitcoins amazing success and the obvious solutions blockchains offer, many other cryptocurrencies have been launched, known as alt-coins (some listed above ). Some of these are clones or “forks” of bitcoin while others were built from scratch. By November 2021 the aggregate value of all crypto currencies had reached 2.1trillion – BTC  represented approx. 41% of that total value. 

 

Fiat currencies are a crypto currency that has its value pegged to that of a standard currency E.g USD , pound etc 

 

As of December 2021, El Salvador is the only country in the world to allow bitcoin as legal tender for money for monetary transaction.  Jurisdiction in regard to crypto varies the world over.   

 

Cryptocurrencies are distributed / sold on a variety of exchanges like that of a stock exchange. Some examples of crypto exchanges are binance, kucoin, crypto.com and a variety of brokers the world over. Crypto currencies are also often sold via the company’s website, especially before they are approved for exchanges such as binance etc. 

 

Cryptocurrencies are generated by mining. Mining is a process that involves downloading software that contains a partial or full history of the blockchain and confirming future transactions which is rewarded in a small payout of the cryptocurrency you’re mining. 

 

Crypto currencies are an alternative to our current monetary system.  The goal is to streamline existing financial architecture to make it more efficient, while taking the control away from institutions such as banks and returning it to the masses. 

 

Blockchains and the crypto currencies operating throughout them have the potential to transform well established financial institutions and bring lower costs, faster execution of transactions, improved transparency meaning total reform to our financial sector.  

 

Blockchain will reduce the massive duplication of information that creates delays, conflicts and confusion in many aspects of financial services, for example, when a syndicate of lenders participates in a loan, having one shared ledger means they don’t all need to be tracking the ledger independently. International’s payments and corporate stock records 

Are examples of financial areas with huge inefficiencies because of record duplication. 

 

It is entirely possible that in years to come we will see private businesses implementing their own private blockchains to improve the transparency and traceability of their financial operations, supply chains, inventory management systems and other internal business systems.  

 

Blockchain is destined to create profound changes in almost all industries, for example blockchains will instantiate massive changes to health care, doctors’ clinicians and facilities will have better access to health records without location being a barrier. The transportation industry will see changes to the platform sued to track time, date and condition removes delivery charges for things like delays and damaged products. Retail and manufacturing companies can expect to see changes to the way they respond to consumer demand and could track provenance products. Once implemented blockchain will provide the ability for clear proof of origin for the oil and gas industry, eliminating all black-market concerns among other dubious sources and concerns. Possibly most excitingly blockchain has the ability to remove a lot of the anonymity surrounding governments making the day-to-day actions of our politicians more transparent. 

 

As blockchain becomes more and more of a staple for our modern world, your average human is more and more likely to be interacting with blockchain style technologies on a day-to-day basis. As we have covered above blockchain is destined to cause massive e reform to almost all areas of our lives providing less anonymity to the “powers at be” and less of a veil for them to hide behind. The good news is you wont necessarily notice a difference in how you perform most functions that are destined to be reformed in the future. For example, validating a contract in the future will work a lot the same way, however the way that information is stored will be reformed with the use of blockchain technology making it safer and more transparent for everyone involved.  

All in all I think its extremely likely that blockchain will be affecting almost every part of your life in one way or another in the not so distant future. </p>
